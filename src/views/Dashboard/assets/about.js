### About Me

I have a huge passion for developing full stack applications in React. 

Big Linux nut. You can typically writing bash scripts and working 

on my dotfiles.

Redux is my jam, love playing around with Firebase in my apps.

Love to blog about all things related to React, bash, Linux, 

and general experimentation with code.
